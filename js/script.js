  ♂ Unique behaviour for each ghost? ♂

  ♂ Ghosts animation in separate thread by using Workers API? ♂

  ♂ Add an alert message when trying to leave/reload enter name menu, but can't make it work only on that screen. ♂

  ♂ Slower ghosts when turning corners? ♂

  ♂ Lock it at 60FPS. ♂

  ♂ Add cooldown when a ghost has been eaten, i.e. can't be eaten again for X seconds. SetTimeout is unreliable. ♂

  ♂ When ghost's flee timer ends and it's next to pacman, pacman dies which should not happen. Immnuity set to true does not work in time. Set pacman.immunity = true when ghosts flee mode starts? ♂

  ♂ Yet to be tested on different devices (performance is affected by device's hardware) and higher resolutions (bigger block dimensions can lead to wrong calculations which in turn results in infinite loops or pacman/ghosts getting stuck). ♂
